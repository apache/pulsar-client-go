This document outlines some of the conventions on development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other resources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.

## Steps to Contribute

Since the `go mod` package management tool is used in this project, your go version is required at **Go1.11+**.

### Fork

Before you start contributing, you need to fork [pulsar-client-go](https://github.com/apache/pulsar) to your github repository.

### Installation

##### mac os && linux

```bash
$ mkdir -p $HOME/github.com/apache/
$ cd $HOME/github.com/apache/
$ git clone git@github.com:[your-github-id]/pulsar-client-go.git

$ go mod download
```

When you execute `go mod download`, there may be some libs that cannot be downloaded. You can download them by referring to the proxy provided by [GOPROXY.io](https://goproxy.io/).
